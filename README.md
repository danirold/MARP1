# MARP1

Repository dedicated to non-linear data structures and algorithmic optimization. 
It covers advanced tree structures, priority queues, and graph theory, with a focus on greedy strategies and amortized complexity analysis to achieve efficient polynomial-time solutions.
This collection includes solved problems from the MARPI (Algorithmic Methods for Problem Solving I) course, part of the Computer Engineering degree at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).
